Pre-requisites:
1) Existing backend project (and database) already deployed to your Heroku cloud app
2) Fully completed React project

Steps:
1) Open package.json and update the value of "proxy" from "http://localhost:8080" to your Heroku app URL e.g. "https://myappABC.herokuapp.com"
2) Open a terminal and run "npm run build"
3) Verify that a "build" folder has been created and populated in your React project (DO NOT AMEND ANY OF ITS CONTENTS!)
4) Locate and copy the contents of this build folder in your React project directory
5) Go into the src/main/resources/static folder of your Spring Boot project directory and paste the contents here
6) Re-deploy your Spring Boot project to Heroku
7) Check that you are now able to access your React front-end and Spring Boot back-end online at your Heroku app URL e.g. "https://myappABC.herokuapp.com"
